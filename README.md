# Object Finder

## Overview

Object Finder is a Python project that uses the DeepLabV3+ model to identify people in an image and highlight them with a colored overlay.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Install the required libraries using the following command:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ObjectFinder.git
   cd ObjectFinder
   ```

2. Run the project using the provided script:

   ```bash
   python3 ./src/main.py
   ```

## Details

- The project uses the DeepLabV3+ model from torchvision to perform semantic segmentation on the input image.
- Identified people are highlighted with a specified color and transparency level.
- OpenCV is utilized for image processing.

## File Structure

- `src/main.py`: The main script to run the object finder.
- `data/sample_images/`: Contains sample images for testing.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python libraries and their versions.
